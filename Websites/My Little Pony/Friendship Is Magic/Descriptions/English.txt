A website to thank and honor the cartoon "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic".
For being so awesome, and beautiful, making me happy, and making part of my childhood and life.
And also for helping me in difficult moments of my life, and for being there for me.
I love "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic" a lot.
I love it so much, since 2013, when I knew about it on the Internet, maybe in Google+.
A website made with much care and love ❤️ by Izaque Sanvezzo (Stake2, Funkysnipa Cat).
