# Stake2-PHP
The PHP files for the Stake2 Website https://thestake2.netlify.app/<br>
HTML files in here [Stake2 Website](https://github.com/stake2/stake2-website)<br>
Made by me, [Stake2](https://github.com/stake2)

The websites are loaded from the files inside the [Tabs](https://github.com/stake2/stake2-php/tree/master/Tabs) folder, the [Index.php](https://github.com/stake2/stake2-php/blob/master/Index.php) file selects the website and creates the page.
