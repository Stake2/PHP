# diario-php
The PHP files for the Diario website https://diario.netlify.app/<br>
Made by me, [stake2](https://github.com/stake2)

The websites are loaded from the files inside the [Tabs](https://github.com/stake2/diario-php/tree/master/Tabs) folder, the [Index.php](https://github.com/stake2/diario-php/blob/master/Index.php) file selects the website and creates the page.
