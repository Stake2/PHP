Thank you for everything, I thank for this amazing Fandom, and for this amazing cartoon, for being part of my life, my childhood.
I came across this wonderful cartoon on Google+ between 2011 and 2013 in a video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72uPRh6w9M">"Don't Watch The Cartoon Called My Little Pony"</a> in Portuguese, and I went to watch xD, it changed my life.
Because of it, I met many nice people, some who are no longer with me (they are no longer my friends and I have no contact), and some who stayed, I thank the cartoon "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic" and its Fandom.
Its community, for all this affection, all the songs, animations, memes, stories, fan arts (drawings), moments when I cried watching the show.
When I was sad, they helped me see life differently, made me happy, and talked about things that spoke volumes to what I was living at the time.
All of these 9 years together, the board "/mlp/" from the 4chan site that was where MLP started to be known.
The <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/pt/">"Brazilian My Little Pony Wikia/Fandom"</a>, Google+ communities: Ponies Transantes, Uni√£o Brony√©tica, √âpicoPooper.
I did three stories about "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic" that are not yet published: "The Visit of Izaque", "Rise to Equestria", and "A New Generation".
Everything I knew and learned from "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic" was really good, it was fun, it made me happy ‚ù§Ô∏è üòä.
Thank you from my heart, I'm Izaque Sanvezzo, Stake2, Funkysnipa Cat on Google+, I'm writing from 2019, and I'm remaking this site on 11/03/2021.
I really love "My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic" and these six wonderful ponies.
Twilight Sparkle, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Applejack, Rarity ‚ù§Ô∏è üòä.
I love them so much, and I wanted to live in Equestria, I wanted to visit Equestria and Ponyville just like Izaque in my story "The Visit of Izaque".
